        description: "13-week intensive bootcamp designed to make its students work-ready software developers. By working with employers, the course is tailored to provide the skills you desire. \nThe course ensured we used fundamental concepts such as test-driven development, object-oriented programming and paired programming from the start, preparing us for a working environment. \n In the back-end segment, we became familiar with asynchronous programming, RESTful APIs and Hosting databases. In the front-end segment, we learnt about the DOM, semantic HTML and responsive CSS. After each lecture we had the time to get hands on with what we had learnt via a sprint. I created a reddit style social news platform, linked below. \nBack-end project repository: https://github.com/kawooky/be-nc-news \nFront-end Project repository: https://github.com/kawooky/fe-nc-news \nIn the final project phase, I was placed in a group of 5. We were set the task of creating an original product using technologies we hadn't used before. We decided to create a social gym mobile application using mainly react native. We worked well as a team using a mixture of paired, group and solo programming. In just 3 weeks we were able to create an app that we were all incredibly proud of. \nProject phase repository: https://github.com/kawooky/fe-nc-socialift"
